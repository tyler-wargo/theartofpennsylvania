        <p>The homebrewing section of my blog will have to wait. Unfortunately I am unable to brew until I get my Robobrew fixed. I just have to seal the bottom crimp with high heat-resistent, food grade silicone paste. I'll be able to get that project moving within a couple months.<p>

        <p>This is where we'll take a look at some information regarding homebrewing. From recipes to my spin on walkthroughs, it will be an interesting read.</p>

        <p>Making your own beer can be extremely rewarding and extremely dissapointing. No matter how the batch turns out, it's always fun creating something that is your own. All you need to know is: steep grains in water, add yeast, hurry up and wait..</p>
