        <p>White-tail season might be coming to an end in my area, but I can still write about the pheasant hunts i've experienced in December 18' and December 19'.</p>

        <p>December 26th 2018 was a long while ago, it was my first time ever hunting birds. I was using my Remington 20g shotgun with [2 1/2] - [7/8] - 8, shells. I didn't wear shit high boots and there were puddles everywhere. So by the end of the hunt; I was soaked. I had missed pretty much every bird I shot at, but still had a really great time with my friends and their dads. They had expressed an interest for me to join in the hunt the following year as well so with my new found interest; I found myself looking forward to the next hunt.</p>

        <p>December 2019 was a lot better (i'm not sure on the day). Before I go further, I received my 20 gauge Remington shotgun for a Christmas present after I had taken my hunter safety course. I was in middle school at the time so I think I was 11 or 12. I hunted for white-tail deer with it for a couple years with only getting one shot off that missed a doe. Anyway, the shotgun had a scope with a rail. I was able to remove the rail that was held on by the gun's pins. After that, the pins had no locking mechanism now that the rail was removed. In turn, this took me to the local hardware store to pick up some nuts. I was able to match the pins with the correct size nut and washer in no time. Now that I didn't need to stare down a small window beneath the rail to aim for a bird, I was able to hit just about every shot. Aiming roughly 3ft in front of the bird's direction of travel enabled me to dispatch the bird in mid-air. Again, this year was a lot better. I felt as though I actually participated in the killing of my dinner. Which I had made 'Pheasant Nuggets' for dinner one night. They were delicious.</p>

        <p>This is where i'll document some information regarding hunting. This section will probably have to wait until next year since white-tail season is coming to end in my area.</p>
