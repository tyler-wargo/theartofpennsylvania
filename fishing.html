        <p>Ok, to start off this post I would like to talk about my friend Alec's and my fishing day on Saturday the 22nd. We witnessed a Muskrat swim through the crick like a damn submarine. Can you believe that? Probably not. I mean, if someone told you they saw a Muskrat one day, and a Bigfoot the next day; you would believe the Bigfoot story.</p>

        <p>Saturday was probably the type of fishing day every trout fisherman thinks about. It was cooler in the morning and gradually warmed up through the afternoon. If I remember correctly, it was around 45F by one o'clock. It was extremely sunny; which is a rarity in Pittsburgh winters. I woke up that morning to a text from Alec that said "Let's slay.", which we did. We caught copious amounts of fish. Six a piece which was a lot more than we had so far this winter. We had also seen three or four Bald Eagles circling above us. Most likely thinking about all of the trout we were hoarding. (We have been catching and releasing all of the fish brought ashore) The Bald Eagles had made a nest in North Park and their names are Mr. Carson and Ms. Rachel. There's a whole Facebook group dedicated to them called North Park Bald Eagles.</p>

        <p>All day long the trout were swimming around our hooks like sharks. There were down periods during the peak time, but the majority of the time we were catching fish. Alec and I caught fish at exactly the same time! On another note, I had personally learned how gentle Brook Trout really are that day. I nearly killed two of them from keeping them out of the water far too long. I've learned not to keep them in the air for more than a minute or two. If it was taking too long to get the hook out of the fish, I would either hold it under the water while trying to get some oxygen/water into its gills or put it back in the net to do the same. That way, the fish wasn't over stressed even if it had swallowed the hook which can take a while to remove without causing too much damage i.e. (strong content) ripping its stomach out. Always keep your line in the water and always have a Thermos full of some sort of extremely hot - delicious beverage.</p>

        <p>Today, on Monday, I was able to fish for a couple hours but only caught one small Brookie. Some days are better than others I guess.<p>

        <p>As of recently, i've been staying relatively close to my residence when finding a place to fish. I've been going to either North Park Lake or Pine Creek. Which has a variety of locations to choose from depending on the conditions. When it comes to my gear, I will always bring two rods so that I can double my chances of catching a fish. I also like to use a backpack instead of a tacklebox. It makes moving around easier and helps keeps your organization in check.</p>

        <p>If i'm going to fish the lake, i'll use one rod to bottom fish and one rod to fish with a lure. Typically, it's difficult to use two rods if i'm fishing a creek, but i'm sure you can find the perfect spot to somehow use two rods. Lately, we've been catching the stocked Brook trout out of the lake and Pine Creek.</p>

        <p>At the lake, i've been catching the Brookies (with my bottom rod) with Berkley Gulp! Earthworms (Small). I also keep Berkley Gulp! Maggots in my backpack as well. Although, I haven't used the maggots enough to say if they work well or not. The earthworms are tried and true in my case. In terms of lures, i've been using rooster tails and spoons. During these winter months, the fish are extremely slow. So it's in your best interest to reel your lure in as slow as possible, while keep the tip of the rod up so that you can avoid snags. If you do end up getting a snag, my buddy taught me a trick: tighten up the drag, pull the line between the reel and the first eyehole out to the side as if you are casting, then let go so that the line violently snaps back to the pole. Usually this trick will work, and works best when snagged on a rock rather than wood.</p>

        <p>When I fish Pine Creek, i've been ditching the two pole method (not enough room) and stick with my bottom rod. I use a split-shot big enough to keep a 5mm diameter piece of Powerbait. The powerbait and split-shot should be far enough apart but not too far. Depending on the depth of the water - 10-13". So far i've been catching them on Powerbait Extra Scent Yellow (some say Salmon-peach) Glitter Trout Bait. I also keep Powerbait Original Scent Chartruese and Bubblegum (Pink/White) in my backpack that also work.</p>

        <p>Sometimes the Powerbait or Berkley earthworms/maggots stop working or aren't working. Which means I usually go to the lure. It helps a lot if you have a shorter rod for situations where larger rods get in the way. I've caught fish every which way in different conditions. It never hurts to try anything!</p>

        <p>On a side note, I use FishAngler (iOS app) to check the fishing forecast. It has all sorts of helpful information in it. I've read that fish feed depending on the phase of the moon and the location of the moon in relation to the Earth. I wouldn't say it's 100% dependable but it doesn't hurt your chances of catching a fish.</p>
