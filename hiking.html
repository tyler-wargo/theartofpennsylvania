        <p>I have to get way more pictures on these section. There are so many great places to hike around my area with really cool views.</p>

        <p>Yesterday (Wed. the 26th) Nala and I went hiking at our usual spot. The weather wasn't being very kind to us that day as it was pouring down rain. Luckily it was 47F so the rain really wasn't as bad as it could've been. I like my shin high boots to keep my pant legs from getting soaked on wet hikes, but they are extremely heavy. I've been real sore from hiking with them up and down hills for an hour. I'll have to look into getting some lighter boots that still cover the pant legs.</p>

        <h3>February 24th, 2020</h3>
        <p>I go hiking for at least an hour just about every day, or I at least try to go every day. My dog really got me into hiking. She has a ton of energy even now at the age of 9. About five or six years ago, I decided to use the iOS app AllTrails and hike around Hartwood Acres. I wanted to know every single trail and didn't care if it took 6 hours. Luckily, I was able to find a nice loop that takes about an hour to complete.</p>

        <p>I feel extremely responsible for Nala's well-being. I know she won't be around forever, and in fact, her life is quite short. She doesn't care about anything other than being with me at all times. That makes me feel loved. So I feel like I owe her a good life, which I do, and all dog owners do. Their companions deserve a nice life that involves love, good nutrition, plenty of exercise, and a dog-social life. Very cliche, but dogs really are man's best friend.</p>

        <p>I really love getting out in the woods. There is so much to see out there. Mushroom hunting is something that I enjoy as well. Not sure if I should make a whole section on it. I'll probably just add some mushroom flair to the post titles in the hiking section.</p>

        <h3 class="date-post-title">February 12th, 2020</h3>
        <p>I am starting this blog post out on the areas to hike around my area. North Park, Hartwood Acres, and the section of Rachel Carson Trail off of Wildwood Road are some of the places I frequent.</p>

        <p>Typically when i'm hiking, I have a telescoping trekking pole (game changer), my backpack with water/snacks, and my dog. My dog is always on a retractable leash. (Please keep your dog on a leash. It's for others, not for you. Hate to be 'that guy', but my dog has been attacked by other dogs a couple times. So I don't have time for that kind of nonsense any longer.) Also, depending on how cold it is, she will have her dog-jacket on as well. Even if you're not feelin' the cold outside; trust that you will not be cold 15 minutes into your hike. (Unless it's negative degrees outside, then it's a good day for a nice stew) If it's wet outside (or raining), I will use my shin-high rubber boots. There's nothing worse than wet feet while you're hiking!</p>

        <p>As far as clothing goes, always dress appropriately for the weather. If it is cold outside, make sure you layer up. I always wear long pants in the woods. Even in the summer with 90 degree heat. It can be uncomfortable, but ticks are more of a problem than sweaty legs! (Insects are the reason I look forward to winter hiking). More to come!</p>
